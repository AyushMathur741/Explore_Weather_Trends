# Explore_Weather_Trends
In this project, I have analysed the local temperature i.e. Bengaluru’s temperature data and global temperature data. I extracted the relevant data from Udacity’s SQL Workspace. I have used Jupyter notebook and Python programming language to manipulate and visualize the data.  Goals:    1. Extraction of data from database and export it to CSV. 2. Import CSV and manipulate data. 3. Visualize the data (Create Line Graphs). 4. Make observations.
